# Menus-App
This app takes in an image of a plate of food, identifies and segments the food in the plate, and outputs the nutritional information of the plate based off data taken from Purdue's dining services. The data collection and much of the modeling is complete, but it is yet to be deployed. Soon it will be on Streamlit.
